wordle: 

APIs used: https://api.datamuse.com/words?sp=${word}&max=1 and https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=10
Why: This was my first time using APIs so I was searching online for APIs to use. Random word helps to generate a random word for the game and Datamuse validates those words.

What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?
I was happy to figure out how to get the random words to be 5 letter random words. I was stumped for so long because I thought the words would automatically be 5 letters long and thus the rest of my code was broken somewhow.
